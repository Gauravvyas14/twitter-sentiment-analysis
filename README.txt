PIG POJECT TO CHECK HOW MANY TWEETS HAVE EMOTIONS, AND WHEATHER THEY ARE POSITIVE EMOTIONS OR NEGATIVE EMOTIONS.

FOR THIS I HAVE USED WORD LISTS OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS PRESENTED BY "Bing Liu and Minquing Hu."

FETCHED TWITTER DATA WITH THE HELP OF FLUME.

FLUME VERSION USED WAS apache-flume-1.4.0.

PIG VERSION USED WAS PIG-0.11.0 ON CLOUDERA CDH4.


SCRIPTS AND UDFS WERE RAN IN LOCAL JVM MODE , UPON SAMPLE DATA OF 5 MB.

LOGIC BEHIND UDFS WAS- 

1. --Sentiments.java--UDF TO CHECK IF TWEETS CONTAINS SENTIMENTS OR NOT, FOR THIS I HAVE USED FILTERFUNC UDF. 
FROM LISTS OF WORDS FOR BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS I HAVE MADE A SINGLE LIST WITH NAME
sentiment.txt. I HAVE USED THIS LIST TO MAKE AN ARRAYLIST OF SENTIMENTS AND CHECKED IF TEXT OF
TWEETS CONTAINS THOSE WORDS OR NOT, IF IT RETURNED TRUE, I FILTERED AND KEPT IT FOR FURTHER PROCESSING

2. --IfPositive.java--UDF TO CHECK IF TWEETS CONTAIN POSITIVE EMOTION, FOR THIS I AGAIN USED FILTERFUNC UDF
AND FROM POSITIVE EMOTION LIST, I MADE AN ARRAYLIST TO CHECK TWEETS.
IF IT RETURNED TRUE I KEPT IT AS TWEETS WITH POSITIVE EMOTIONS, AND IF IT RETURNED FALSE I KEPT IT AS 
TWEETS WITH NEGATIVE EMOTIONS.

FINALLY I COUNTED NUMBER OF TWEETS WITH POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EMOTIONS FOR EACH USERS AND STORED THEM SEPRATELY IN OUTPUT.
